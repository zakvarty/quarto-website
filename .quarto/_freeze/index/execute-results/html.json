I particularly enjoy developing efficient inference methods for non-standard data generating mechanisms and data science projects with environmental or industrial applications.\n\n<!-- I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the [STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/). My PhD focused on modelling model induced earthquake activity by combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference.-->\n\nWhen I'm not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running and I love to read üèÉ üìñ. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake!\n\n\n:::\n\n<!--Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!-->\n\n",
