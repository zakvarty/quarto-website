I am particularly interested in modelling environmental and industrial processes.\n\nI work as a teaching fellow at **[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics)**. In my work, I lead courses and supervise research projects in statistics, data science and data ethics.\n\nPreviously, I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the **[STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/)** at **[Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)**. My PhD work combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference to model induced earthquake activity.\n\nWhen I am not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running üèÉ and I love to read üìñ. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake.\n\n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions!\n\n:::\n<!--\n\n---\n\n## Education\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego | San Diego, CA\nPhD in Mathematics | Sep 2011 - June 2015\n\nMacalester College | St. Paul MA\nB.A in Economics | Sep 2007 - June 2011\n\n---\n\n\n## Experience\n\nWengo Analytics | Head Data Scientist | April 2018 - present\n\nGeoScynce | Chief Analyst | Spet 2012 - April 2018\n\n\n\n## Research Interests \n\nI am interested using statistical reasoning to better understand, explain and predict complex processes. I am particularly interested by problems relating to the environmental sciences or industrial applications. \n\nI develop models and inference procedures by drawing on a broad range of techniques from statistics and data science. Much of my work has centred around the use of stochastic point process models, Bayesian inference and extreme value theory.\n\n## Statistical Consulting \n\nIn addition to academic research I have experience working as a consultant statistician on a variety of industrial problems including inspection planning, predictive analytics and process optimisation.  \n\n## PhD research\nMy research focused on developing statistical models to describe and understand earthquakes that are caused by gas extraction in the Netherlands. \n-->\n\n\n<!-- <center><img src=\"Groningen_window_europeII-1.png\" width=\"30%\"></center> -->\n\n<!--\nHuman-induced earthquakes are usually smaller in magnitude and fewer in number than their tectonic counterparts. This low-data setting is a challenge to statistical modelling and necessitates the inclusion of domain-expert knowledge. If this low-data setting was not challenging enough, changes in gas extraction and earthquake detection lead to further complications and inefficiencies if standard modelling approaches are used.\n\nMy PhD research developed statistical methodology to make most efficient use of the limited available data and extended existing earthquake models to improve understanding of these induced seismic events. \n\nYou can find a copy of my thesis [here](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/services/downloadRegister/337085704/2021VartyPhD.pdf). \n\n\n## Outputs\n\n### Publications \n*Varty, Z.*, Tawn J.A., Atkinson P.M. and Bierman S.

Applications, parallelisation and extensions of the technique were reviewed.\n\n_Inference on censored networks:_ Networks are censored when existing nodes or edges are not observed. Methods for inference under different types of missingness were explored. Master's project supervised by Dr. Christopher Nemeth.\n\n_Computionally intensive methods for modelling houshold epidemics:_\nApproximate Bayesian Computation was utilised to allow inference on disease models with intractable likelihoods. Master's dissertation supervised by Prof. Peter Neal.\n\n-->\n",
