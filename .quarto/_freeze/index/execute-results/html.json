I am particularly interested in modelling environmental and industrial processes.\n\nI work as a teaching fellow at **[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics)**. In my work, I lead courses and supervise research projects in statistics, data science and data ethics.\n\nPreviously, I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the **[STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/)** at **[Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)**. My PhD work combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference to model induced earthquake activity.\n\nWhen I am not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running üèÉ and I love to read üìñ. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake.\n\n\n<!-- Feel free to contact me if you have any questions! --> \n:::\n",
