This low-data setting is a challenge to statistical modelling and necessitates the inclusion of domain-expert knowledge. If this low-data setting was not challenging enough, changes in gas extraction and earthquake detection lead to further complications and inefficiencies if standard modelling approaches are used.\n\nMy PhD research developed statistical methodology to make most efficient use of the limited available data and extended existing earthquake models to improve understanding of these induced seismic events. \n\nYou can find a copy of my thesis on [github](https://github.com/zakvarty/varty_thesis_public). \n\n\n## PhD outputs\n\n### Publications \n*Varty, Z.*, Tawn J.A., Atkinson P.M. and Bierman S.

Applications, parallelisation and extensions of the technique were reviewed.\n\n__Inference on censored networks:__ Networks are censored when existing nodes or edges are not observed. Methods for inference under different types of missingness were explored. Master's project supervised by Dr. Christopher Nemeth.\n\n__Computionally intensive methods for modelling houshold epidemics:__\nApproximate Bayesian Computation was utilised to allow inference on disease models with intractable likelihoods. Master's dissertation supervised by Prof. Peter Neal.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"research.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["litera","../custom.scss"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
