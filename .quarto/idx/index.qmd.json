I am particularly interested in modelling environmental and industrial processes.\n\nI work as a teaching fellow at **[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics)**. In my work, I lead courses and supervise research projects in statistics, data science and data ethics.\n\nPreviously, I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the **[STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/)** at **[Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)**. My PhD work combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference to model induced earthquake activity.\n\nWhen I am not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running `r emo::ji(\"running\")` and I love to read `r emo::ji(\"book\")`. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake.\n\n\n<!-- Feel free to contact me if you have any questions! --> \n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":["litera","custom.scss"],"title":"Zak Varty","about":{"template":"solana","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/zakvarty"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/zakvarty"},{"icon":"google","text":"Google Scholar","href":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3H4vg4cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
