## About This Repo 

This repository contains the source code to build my personal website, which is hosted at [zakvarty.com](https://www.zakvarty.com/).

The website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

If you find any mistakes, broken bits or anything that isn't working as it should then please [raise an issue](https://github.com/zakvarty/quarto-website/issues) to let me know.


## What is Quarto and how do I get stared? 

Quarto is an open-source system for scientific and technical publishing. It's a bit like a jupyter notebook on steroids.

Quarto provides a unified approach to literate programming in a range of languages: out-of-the-box there is support for R, Python, Julia and Observable. It also covers many different output types, all from a single markdown source file. Quarto can be compiled to HTML documents, sites and slides; PDF documents and MS Word docs - all through the magic of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

If you've not heard of Quarto before, I'd encourage you to have a play around with it. Some starter projects, building in difficulty.

1. :arrow_down: [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) - it's easy, I promise. 
2. :memo: Try making [your first Quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html). (Bonus points for html + pdf output)
3. :film_projector: Jazz things up and try [making some slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/) (Pretty from the start, gorgeous with a little extra HTML and CSS).
4. :bust_in_silhouette:Create or revamp your own [personal website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
5. :writing_hand: Add a blog to that website, perhaps by [following my tutorial](https://www.zakvarty.com/blog/2022-09-26-adding-a-quarto-blog/)!
