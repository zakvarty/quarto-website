## Outreach 

I was an active member of the Royal Statistical Societyâ€™s Lancashire & East Cumbria local group from 2017-2020. The group organises seminars and events to bring together those with an interest in data both within and outside of academia. I served as treasurer for the group for two years from 2017-2019.

I have also been involved in delivering university open days since 2016. At these events I have delivered mini-lectures to promote statistical thinking, raise awareness of available funding, and to promote the option of studying abroad.
