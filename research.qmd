# Research 

## Research Interests 

My research interests lie in the intersection between applied and methodological statistics. My past projects focused on missing data, predictive analytics, extreme value analysis and point process modelling.

I'm particularly interested in developing efficient inference methods for non-standard data generating mechanisms to better model the rich, complex data sets that arise from environmental and industrial processes.

## Past Projects 


__Inference for extreme earthquake magnitudes accounting for a time-varying measurement process.__ ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00884))  Motivated by earthquake catalogues, we consider variable data quality in the form of rounded and incompletely observed data. We develop an approach to select a time-varying modelling threshold that makes best use of the available data in an extreme value analysis, accounting for uncertainty in the magnitude model and for the rounding of observations. 

__Statistical Modelling of Induced Earthquakes__ ([PhD Thesis](https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/thesis/1436)). My PhD thesis focused on how to model anthropogenic earthquakes while making best use of the limited available data. Firstly, a selection of physically-motivated parametric models are explored for describing the link between gas extraction and induced earthquake locations. Secondly, new inference methods are developed that allow improvements to the earthquake detection network to be included when modelling extreme earthquake magnitudes. Finally, a reparameterised and extended version of the Epidemic Type Aftershock model introduced. This both allows for more efficient inference and relaxes the common assumption of independent and identically distributed magnitudes.

__A review of simulated annealing techniques:__ Simulated annealing is a metahuristic technique mainly used for combinatorial optimisation. Applications, parallelisation and extensions of the technique were reviewed.

__Inference on censored networks:__ Networks are censored when existing nodes or edges are not observed. Methods for inference under different types of missingness were explored. Master's project supervised by Dr. Christopher Nemeth.

__Computionally intensive methods for modelling houshold epidemics:__
Approximate Bayesian Computation was utilised to allow inference on disease models with intractable likelihoods. Master's dissertation supervised by Prof. Peter Neal.

<!-- 
My PhD research focused on developing statistical models to describe and understand earthquakes that are caused by gas extraction in the Netherlands. 

Human-induced earthquakes are usually smaller in magnitude and fewer in number than their tectonic counterparts. This low-data setting is a challenge to statistical modelling and necessitates the inclusion of domain-expert knowledge. If this low-data setting was not challenging enough, changes in gas extraction and earthquake detection lead to further complications and inefficiencies if standard modelling approaches are used.

My PhD research developed statistical methodology to make most efficient use of the limited available data and extended existing earthquake models to improve understanding of these induced seismic events.
