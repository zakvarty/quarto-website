# Teaching

I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to teach in a variety of roles. These have included:

- Developing and teaching modules in statistics, data science and data ethics. I have designed courses for both in-person and remote learning, predominantly at the postgradute level.

- Supervising undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral research projects. 

- Adapting and leading short courses on scientific writing and communication.

- Running workshops and computer labs for undergraduate and postgraduate modules.

- Speaking at university open days and providing one-to-one tuition to high school students.


I am an associate fellow of the Higher Education Academy, which you can learn more about [here](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship). I am currently working toward full fellowship to further develop my teaching practice.
