</div>
<p>While teaching a course on supervised learning last year, several students asked about what books I would recommended on statistical inference and modelling.</p>
<p>For context, the students on this course are all highly numerate and studying at the postgraduate level. What makes this request challenging is the broad range of student backgrounds, some students had a maths degree but the majority are trained and work as engineers, physicists or computer scientists.</p>
<p>This variety in backgrounds and exposure to undergraduate level statistics made recommending a single book difficult. Instead, I compiled a list of books that I have enjoyed or found useful. For each book I tried to give some guidance on whether it might match with their current statistical knowledge and what they are trying to achieve. I gave a brief description of the level and target audience of each text, which I reproduce below.</p>
<p>When evaluating whether these resources might suit your current needs, I find it helpful to skim through a section on a topic that you already know (such as linear regression). This is usually the fastest and most reliable way to assess if the book is going to be a good fit for you.</p>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive. If you know of any gems that I have not included in this list, please do let me know!</p>

</div>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="rice2007mathematical">Rice (2007)</span> covers the basics of probability and statistics usually contained in the first couple of undergraduate statistics courses. Generally the first university courses are a bit dry, building up the required knowledge to do interesting things. This book is slightly better than the average treatment in terms of readability and is fairly comprehensive, making it well suited as a reference text. This is a book full of all the stuff you might once have known but have now forgotten, or never studied before.</p>

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="kirkwood2010essential">Kirkwood and Sterne (2010)</span> focuses on more advanced topics in statistics, such as inference, hypothesis testing and modelling. However, it approaches these from an applications perspective. While all of the applications it uses are from medical statistics, the authors give sufficient context that you do not need to be familiar with this area before reading. This is a very readable book, with a moderate amount of mathematical detail. I find myself revisiting it quite often.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wood2015core">Wood (2015)</span> gives an introduction to the core topics in statistics aimed at new graduate-level students. It is mathematically dense but written in an approachable manner and (unsurprisingly) covers all the core ideas of statistics. This means that is often a good source to get an overview of a topic and to cover the key points in that area quickly. It is probably wise to supplement this with a more applied text to see worked examples and to a more detailed text for topics that you need to explore in greater detail.</p>

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="pawitan2001all">Pawitan (2001)</span> focuses entirely on likelihood inference and covers both theory and applications in a great deal of detail. I highly recommend this to supplement frequentist topics covered in core statistics and the elements of statistical learning. It builds up from very little assumed knowledge but also goes on to cover some very advanced topics in later chapters.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bayesian-statistics">Bayesian Statistics</h2>
<p>We only consider frequentist approaches to inference in this course. However, I would be remiss to not include some Bayesian texts and leave you with the impression that classical or frequentist approaches to statistics are the only option.</p>
<p>Many of the topics we cover in supervised learning can be considered from a Bayesian perspective. A Bayesian statistician does not treat our model parameters as fixed but unknown quantities, instead they consider the parameters as random variables and use probability distributions to describe their (or our) beliefs about the parameter values.</p>
<p>You might find the following books useful, either during or after the Bayesian inference course. The former is more theoretical, while the latter has a more applied focus.</p>

<p>A rhetorical precis is a short summary and analysis of a piece of writing, which considers both the content and the delivery of the piece.</p>
<p>A rhetorical precis serves to summarise and analyse the text through:</p>
<ul>
<li>an accurate bibliographic reference to the text,</li>
<li>a list of keywords relating to the text,</li>
<li>a highly structured four-sentence paragraph providing a summary and analysis of the text.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="why-write-one" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-write-one">Why write one?</h2>
<p>Keeping a rhetorical precis for each text that you read is a fantasitc way to build the skills of active reading and succinct writing. A rhetorical precis is more informative than a bib entry and more easily reviewed <em>(read: waded through)</em> than a stack of annotated papers.</p>
<p>Taken collectively, a set of rhetorical precis summaries provide a reading record that can be a tremendously useful when trying to recall the contents of a paper or book long after you originally read it.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-store-them" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-store-them">How to store them?</h2>
<p>Writing and storing these reading summaries electronically can make them even more useful. This allows you to search for topics, target audiences or keywords.</p>
<p>For this reason it can be helpful to keep them all together in one word document or plain text file. Alternatively, having a single folder with each summary as a plain text or markdown file works well if you are comfortable with searching at the command line. The same can be achieved by writing these summaries within a reference manager, if that is something you are invested in already.</p>

<section id="definition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Just to prove that I’m not making all this up:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A rhetorical precis analyzes both the content (the what) and the delivery (the how) of a unit of spoken or written discourse. It is a highly structured four-sentence paragraph blending summary and analysis. Each of the four sentences requires specific information; students are expected to use brief quotations (to convey a sense of the author’s style and tone) and to include a terminal bibliographic reference. Practicing this sort of writing fosters precision in both reading and writing, forcing a writer to employ a variety of sentence structures and to develop a discerning eye for connotative shades of meaning. <br> <strong>Attribution:</strong> <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/englishcomp2kscopex92x2/chapter/rhetorical-precis/">lumenlearning.com</a></p>

<section id="format" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Four sentences summarising the aim of the work, how this is addressed, why it is important and a description of the target audience.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Name of author, [optional phrase describing author], genre and title of work, date in parentheses (additional publishing information in parentheses); a rhetorically accurate verb (such as “asserts,” “argues,” suggests,” “implies,” claims,” etc.); a THAT clause containing the major assertion or thesis statement of the work.</li>
<li>An explanation of <em>how</em> the author develops and/or supports the thesis, usually in chronological order.</li>
<li>A statement of the author’s purpose followed by an “in order to” phrase.</li>
<li>A description of the intended audience and/or the essay’s tone</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-self-indulgent-example">A (self-indulgent) example</h2>
<p>Here is a rather self-indulgent example of a rhetorical precis.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>varty2021inference</code></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Inference for extreme earthquake magnitudes accounting for a time-varying measurement process. {ArXiV preprint, 2021} (20 pages).</em></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> <em>Zak Varty, Jonathan Tawn, Peter Atkinson and Stijn Bierman.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key words:</strong> <em>extreme value</em>, <em>earthquake</em>, <em>threshold selection</em>, <em>magnitude of completion</em>, <em>seismology</em>, <em>bootstrap.</em></p>
<p>In this paper, Varty et al (2021) propose a new threshold selection method for modelling earthquake catalogues, where the magnitude distribution is stationary but detection of small events improves over time. The paper generalises the Gutenberg-Richter law to the GPD and uses metrics based on PP and QQ plots to balance between bias and variance when selecting a time-varying threshold. This procedure more than doubles the usable catalogue size for Groningen earthquakes and gives the first emprircal evidence that the magnitude distribution in this region has a finite upper end point. The paper is targeted at applied and research statisticians with an interest in EVT but would also be accessible to a statistically-minded seismologist.</p>

  <title>Setting up a quarto blog</title>
  <dc:creator>Zak Varty</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zakvarty.com/blog/2022-09-26-adding-a-quarto-blog/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="what-am-i-trying-to-do" class="level1">
<h1>What am I trying to do?</h1>
<div class="medium_right">
<p><img style="border-radius: 10%;" src="https://www.zakvarty.com/blog/2022-09-26-adding-a-quarto-blog/florian-klauer-mk7D-4UCfmg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Mechanical typewriter on white background"></p>
</div>
<p>My aim here is to set up a blog within an existing quarto website. I want the blog to be a sub-domain of the main site (<code>zakvarty.com/blog</code>) and for it to inherit the styling of that site.</p>
<p>It probably would have been easier to make the blog a sub domain (<code>blog.zakvarty.com</code>) and use two separate but matching style files to make those sites look coherent. However, I wanted to make the most of the built in search features on quarto websites and am a glutton for punishment.</p>
<p>Credit to <a href="https://ddimmery.com/">Drew Dimmery</a>, whose website I used alongside the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/guide/">quarto docs</a> to work out how to get all these pieces working together.</p>
</section>
<section id="steps" class="level1">
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a subdirectory of the website called <code>blog/</code>. This has sub-folders for each blog post and will contain the files of metadata that are common to all blog posts (e.g.&nbsp;default settings for YAML headers information and a bibliography file). <!-- --></li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html">listing page</a> called <code>blog.qmd</code> in the root directory. This will become the blog “landing page” and what we will point to from the website header. <!-- --></li>
<li>Add a “Blog” header item to the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file for the website and set the <code>link:</code> for this to be <code>blog.qmd</code> <!-- --></li>
<li>Added a simple example post to the <code>blog/</code> directory. See for example my <a href="https://www.github.com/zakvarty/quarto-website/blog/hello-world/">hello-world</a> post. <!-- --></li>
<li>Adjust the default YAML parameters for the blog posts by making the file <code>blog/_metadata.yml</code>. These default values can be overwritten by specifying them again in the YAML header at the top of any individual post. For examples of what you might want to include see <a href="https://www.github.com/zakvarty/quarto-website/blog/_metadata.yml">my file</a> or the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html">projects section</a> of the quarto docs. <!-- --></li>
<li>Add a simple bibliography file, called <code>library.bib</code> or similar to the <code>blog/</code> directory. Set this as the default bibliography file for each blog post by adding <code>bibliography: ../library.bib</code> to <code>blog/_metadata.yml</code>. <!-- --></li>
<li>(optional) Create a post template so that you don’t have to memorise header fields. <!-- --></li>
<li>Set your “Hello, World!” and template posts to have <code>draft: true</code> in their headers. This will prevent them from showing up on your website. <!-- --></li>
<li>Set your “Hello, World!” and template posts to have <code>freeze: true</code> in their headers. This will prevent any code in them from re-running each time the website is rendered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Freezing the code within posts will improve the build speed, as well as make the website more stable and portable. See the quarto docs on <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#freezing-posts">freezing posts</a> for more details. My current plan is to have this as <code>false</code> by default and change to <code>true</code> on publication of each post.</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-that-references-work" class="level1">
<h1>Checking that references work</h1>
<p>I have set up a single bibtex file in which to store references for all posts. This lives in the <code>blog/</code> directory and is set as the default <code>bibliography</code> parameter for each post in the file <code>blog/_metadata.yml</code>.</p>
<p>This is an in-line reference to <span class="citation" data-cites="wan2020network">Wan et al. (2020)</span> written as <code>@citationkey</code>. Parenthetical references, such as <span class="citation" data-cites="wan2020network">(Wan et al. 2020)</span>, are written using <code>[@citationkey]</code>. These can be strung together by separating each citation key with a semicolon, for example <span class="citation" data-cites="wan2020network wan2020network">(Wan et al. 2020, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>To let people know the license your work is under and how they should cite your blog posts you can use the <code>appendix-style</code> argument. This can be added to the YAML header of individual blog posts or you can specify a default value in <code>blog/_metadata.yml</code>. There are three options for this parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>default</code> does some nice formatting and makes the text a bit smaller than the rest of the article;</li>
<li><code>plain</code> matches the style of the rest of your post;</li>
<li><code>none</code> does not add any citation details to the end of your post.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m currently using some pretty hacky CSS to style this website so am limited to the latter two options for now. In the process of writing this article I stumbled across some neat SCSS that I hope will fix this issue that I have made for myself! [Update: I changed to SCSS and this is now fixed!]</p>
<p><em>Note: When adding references to your posts, make sure that the <code>site-URL</code> field in your website’s <code>quarto.yml</code> does not have a trailing slash - this will be copied into the reference and break the links.</em></p>

<h1>Some Text</h1>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
