If this low-data setting was not challenging enough, changes in gas extraction and earthquake detection lead to further complications and inefficiencies if standard modelling approaches are used.\nMy PhD research developed statistical methodology to make most efficient use of the limited available data and extended existing earthquake models to improve understanding of these induced seismic events.\nYou can find a copy of my thesis on github.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarty, Z., Tawn J.A., Atkinson P.M. and Bierman S.

    "text": "Title: Incorporating Ethics into the Data Science Curriculum\nSlides \nAbstract:\nData-driven decision making is now pervasive and impacts us all. Your data is used by others to make decisions about who you are, how you will behave, and what options should be made available to you. Predictive models are used to decide anything from the promotion that is offered to you by a retailer through to whether your loan application is granted by a bank.\nThe ways in which these predictive models can fail mathematically form a core part of the training for an aspiring statistician or data scientist. In contrast, the potential for ethical failures in these same models is rarely covered in-depth during as part of this initial training. As a result, these modes of failure are often not considered until those predictive models have been put into production and are actively causing harm. We argue that to prevent this harm, the ethical impacts of using data to make decisions must be made core to the curriculum of both statistics and data science.\nThis talk will describe how this may be done in a way that is appealing to an audience with a strong mathematical focus and that does not require the authoring of extended essays or moral treaties. The discussion is structured around the development of a post-graduate course in the Ethics of Data Science, but the core ideas are salient to all statistics training. Throughout, we give actionable ways in which these topics may be integrated into statistical training at all levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides from talks will be added here."

    "text": "Steps\n\nCreate a subdirectory of the website called blog/. This has sub-folders for each blog post and will contain the files of metadata that are common to all blog posts (e.g. default settings for YAML headers information and a bibliography file). \nCreate a listing page called blog.qmd in the root directory. This will become the blog “landing page” and what we will point to from the website header. \nAdd a “Blog” header item to the _quarto.yml file for the website and set the link: for this to be blog.qmd \nAdded a simple example post to the blog/ directory. See for example my hello-world post. \nAdjust the default YAML parameters for the blog posts by making the file blog/_metadata.yml. These default values can be overwritten by specifying them again in the YAML header at the top of any individual post. For examples of what you might want to include see my file or the projects section of the quarto docs. \nAdd a simple bibliography file, called library.bib or similar to the blog/ directory. Set this as the default bibliography file for each blog post by adding bibliography: ../library.bib to blog/_metadata.yml. \n(optional) Create a post template so that you don’t have to memorise header fields. \nSet your “Hello, World!” and template posts to have draft: true in their headers. This will prevent them from showing up on your website. \nSet your “Hello, World!” and template posts to have freeze: true in their headers. This will prevent any code in them from re-running each time the website is rendered.\n\nFreezing the code within posts will improve the build speed, as well as make the website more stable and portable. See the quarto docs on freezing posts for more details. My current plan is to have this as false by default and change to true on publication of each post.\n\n\nChecking that references work\nI have set up a single bibtex file in which to store references for all posts. This lives in the blog/ directory and is set as the default bibliography parameter for each post in the file blog/_metadata.yml.\nThis is an in-line reference to Wan et al. (2020) written as @citationkey. Parenthetical references, such as (Wan et al. 2020), are written using [@citationkey]. These can be strung together by separating each citation key with a semicolon, for example (Wan et al. 2020, 2020).\nTo let people know the license your work is under and how they should cite your blog posts you can use the appendix-style argument. This can be added to the YAML header of individual blog posts or you can specify a default value in blog/_metadata.yml. There are three options for this parameter:\n\ndefault does some nice formatting and makes the text a bit smaller than the rest of the article;\nplain matches the style of the rest of your post;\nnone does not add any citation details to the end of your post.\n\nI’m currently using some pretty hacky CSS to style this website so am limited to the latter two options for now. In the process of writing this article I stumbled across some neat SCSS that I hope will fix this issue that I have made for myself! [Update: I changed to SCSS and this is now fixed!]\nNote: When adding references to your posts, make sure that the site-URL field in your website’s quarto.yml does not have a trailing slash - this will be copied into the reference and break the links.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWan, Phyllis, Tiandong Wang, Richard A Davis, and Sidney I Resnick. 2020. “Are Extreme Value Estimation Methods Useful for Network Data?” Extremes 23 (1): 171–95.\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{varty2022,\n  author = {Zak Varty},\n  title = {Setting up a Quarto Blog},\n  date = {2022-09-26},\n  url = {https://www.zakvarty.com/blog/2022-09-26-adding-a-quarto-blog},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nZak Varty. 2022. “Setting up a Quarto Blog.” September 26,\n2022. https://www.zakvarty.com/blog/2022-09-26-adding-a-quarto-blog."

    "section": "",
    "text": "While teaching a course on supervised learning last year, several students asked about what books I would recommended on statistical inference and modelling.\nFor context, the students on this course are all highly numerate and studying at the postgraduate level. What makes this request challenging is the broad range of student backgrounds, some students had a maths degree but the majority are trained and work as engineers, physicists or computer scientists.\nThis variety in backgrounds and exposure to undergraduate level statistics made recommending a single book difficult. Instead, I compiled a list of books that I have enjoyed or found useful. For each book I tried to give some guidance on whether it might match with their current statistical knowledge and what they are trying to achieve. I gave a brief description of the level and target audience of each text, which I reproduce below.\nWhen evaluating whether these resources might suit your current needs, I find it helpful to skim through a section on a topic that you already know (such as linear regression). This is usually the fastest and most reliable way to assess if the book is going to be a good fit for you.\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. If you know of any gems that I have not included in this list, please do let me know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRice (2007) covers the basics of probability and statistics usually contained in the first couple of undergraduate statistics courses. Generally the first university courses are a bit dry, building up the required knowledge to do interesting things. This book is slightly better than the average treatment in terms of readability and is fairly comprehensive, making it well suited as a reference text. This is a book full of all the stuff you might once have known but have now forgotten, or never studied before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirkwood and Sterne (2010) focuses on more advanced topics in statistics, such as inference, hypothesis testing and modelling. However, it approaches these from an applications perspective. While all of the applications it uses are from medical statistics, the authors give sufficient context that you do not need to be familiar with this area before reading. This is a very readable book, with a moderate amount of mathematical detail. I find myself revisiting it quite often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWood (2015) gives an introduction to the core topics in statistics aimed at new graduate-level students. It is mathematically dense but written in an approachable manner and (unsurprisingly) covers all the core ideas of statistics. This means that is often a good source to get an overview of a topic and to cover the key points in that area quickly. It is probably wise to supplement this with a more applied text to see worked examples and to a more detailed text for topics that you need to explore in greater detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPawitan (2001) focuses entirely on likelihood inference and covers both theory and applications in a great deal of detail. I highly recommend this to supplement frequentist topics covered in core statistics and the elements of statistical learning. It builds up from very little assumed knowledge but also goes on to cover some very advanced topics in later chapters.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKendall, Stuart, and Ord (1987) is an alternative to In All Likelihood, aimed at a similar audience and level. Split over several volumes this is good to do a deep-dive into a particular topic but probably not one to try and read cover to cover!"

However, I would be remiss to not include some Bayesian texts and leave you with the impression that classical or frequentist approaches to statistics are the only option.\nMany of the topics we cover in supervised learning can be considered from a Bayesian perspective. A Bayesian statistician does not treat our model parameters as fixed but unknown quantities, instead they consider the parameters as random variables and use probability distributions to describe their (or our) beliefs about the parameter values.\nYou might find the following books useful, either during or after the Bayesian inference course. The former is more theoretical, while the latter has a more applied focus.\nKendall’s advanced theory of statistics. Vol. 2B, Bayesian inference.

A rhetorical precis is more informative than a bib entry and more easily reviewed (read: waded through) than a stack of annotated papers.\nTaken collectively, a set of rhetorical precis summaries provide a reading record that can be a tremendously useful when trying to recall the contents of a paper or book long after you originally read it."

    "text": "How to store them?\nWriting and storing these reading summaries electronically can make them even more useful. This allows you to search for topics, target audiences or keywords.\nFor this reason it can be helpful to keep them all together in one word document or plain text file. Alternatively, having a single folder with each summary as a plain text or markdown file works well if you are comfortable with searching at the command line. The same can be achieved by writing these summaries within a reference manager, if that is something you are invested in already."

It is a highly structured four-sentence paragraph blending summary and analysis. Each of the four sentences requires specific information; students are expected to use brief quotations (to convey a sense of the author’s style and tone) and to include a terminal bibliographic reference. Practicing this sort of writing fosters precision in both reading and writing, forcing a writer to employ a variety of sentence structures and to develop a discerning eye for connotative shades of meaning.

The paper generalises the Gutenberg-Richter law to the GPD and uses metrics based on PP and QQ plots to balance between bias and variance when selecting a time-varying threshold. This procedure more than doubles the usable catalogue size for Groningen earthquakes and gives the first emprircal evidence that the magnitude distribution in this region has a finite upper end point. The paper is targeted at applied and research statisticians with an interest in EVT but would also be accessible to a statistically-minded seismologist."
