My PhD work combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference to model induced earthquake activity.\nWhen I am not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running üèÉ and I love to read üìñ.

    "text": "PhD research\nMy research focused on developing statistical models to describe and understand earthquakes that are caused by gas extraction in the Netherlands.\n\nHuman-induced earthquakes are usually smaller in magnitude and fewer in number than their tectonic counterparts. This low-data setting is a challenge to statistical modelling and necessitates the inclusion of domain-expert knowledge. If this low-data setting was not challenging enough, changes in gas extraction and earthquake detection lead to further complications and inefficiencies if standard modelling approaches are used.\nMy PhD research developed statistical methodology to make most efficient use of the limited available data and extended existing earthquake models to improve understanding of these induced seismic events.\nYou can find a copy of my thesis here."
