I am a __statistician__, __data scientist__  and __educator__. 

I develop statistical methodology and data science solutions to solve challenging data problems. I am particularly interested in modelling environmental and industrial processes.

I work as a teaching fellow at **[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics)**. In my work, I lead courses and supervise research projects in statistics, data science and data ethics.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the **[STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/)** at **[Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)**. My PhD work combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference to model induced earthquake activity.

When I am not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running `r emo::ji("running")` and I love to read `r emo::ji("book")`. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake.


Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
