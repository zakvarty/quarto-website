:::{#hero-heading}

I am a __statistician__, __data scientist__  and __educator__. 

I develop statistical methodology and data science solutions to solve challenging data problems. I am particularly interested in modelling environmental and industrial processes.

I work as a teaching fellow at **[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics)**. In my work, I lead courses and supervise research projects in statistics, data science and data ethics.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the **[STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/)** at **[Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)**. My PhD work combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference to model induced earthquake activity.

When I am not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running `r emo::ji("running")` and I love to read `r emo::ji("book")`. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake.


Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

## Research Interests 

I am interested using statistical reasoning to better understand, explain and predict complex processes. I am particularly interested by problems relating to the environmental sciences or industrial applications. 

I develop models and inference procedures by drawing on a broad range of techniques from statistics and data science. Much of my work has centred around the use of stochastic point process models, Bayesian inference and extreme value theory.

## Statistical Consulting 

In addition to academic research I have experience working as a consultant statistician on a variety of industrial problems including inspection planning, predictive analytics and process optimisation.  

## PhD research
My research focused on developing statistical models to describe and understand earthquakes that are caused by gas extraction in the Netherlands.

<!--
Human-induced earthquakes are usually smaller in magnitude and fewer in number than their tectonic counterparts. This low-data setting is a challenge to statistical modelling and necessitates the inclusion of domain-expert knowledge. If this low-data setting was not challenging enough, changes in gas extraction and earthquake detection lead to further complications and inefficiencies if standard modelling approaches are used.

My PhD research developed statistical methodology to make most efficient use of the limited available data and extended existing earthquake models to improve understanding of these induced seismic events.

## Past projects

_A review of simulated annealing techniques:_ Simulated annealing is a metahuristic technique mainly used for combinatorial optimisation. Applications, parallelisation and extensions of the technique were reviewed.

_Inference on censored networks:_ Networks are censored when existing nodes or edges are not observed. Methods for inference under different types of missingness were explored. Master's project supervised by Dr. Christopher Nemeth.

_Computionally intensive methods for modelling houshold epidemics:_
Approximate Bayesian Computation was utilised to allow inference on disease models with intractable likelihoods. Master's dissertation supervised by Prof. Peter Neal.
