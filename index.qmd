I am a statistician, data scientist and educator. 

I work as a Teaching Fellow at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics) where I teach courses and supervise research projects in statistics, data science and data ethics. 

My research interests are at the intersection of applied and methodological statistics. I particularly enjoy developing efficient inference methods for non-standard data generating mechanisms and data science projects with environmental or industrial applications.

<!-- I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research within the [STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/). My PhD focused on modelling model induced earthquake activity by combined point process models with techniques from extreme value theory and Bayesian inference.-->

When I'm not in front of my computer, I enjoy distance running and I love to read `r emo::ji("running")` `r emo::ji("book")`. Ideally, these activities are accompanied by a good cup of coffee and a large slice of cake!
