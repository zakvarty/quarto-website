    Stacked bar chart of yarn weights on Ravelry. Bars are descending order by their fequency, with yarn-type labels written within the bars and count values to the right of the bars. 
    Annotations a handwritten indicate that the most popular yarn weights are 'Fingering' and 'Double Knit', and that there were more missing yarn weights than in all remaining categories combined.

For my first Tidy Tuesday I kept things simple with a stacked bar chart.

I have made several plots using `{ggplot2}` before, but this was my first attempt at making one aesthetically pleasing (forgive the pun).

When making this plot I learned about using custom font, colours, annotations and arrows from a lot of [\@nrennie](https://twitter.com/nrennie "Nicola Rennie - Twitter")'s past examples.
